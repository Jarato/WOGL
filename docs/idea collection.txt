full version 1 (idea collection)
dnaD = dna-Dependency

Creature
(1) Species detection (mean shift clustering)
(2) Sexual System (Petri-Net like structure)
(3) Cling-System (Creatures can cling to plants, rocks and other creatures)

Body
(4) Oval Shaping (dnaD)
(5) Armor (Anglearea) (dnaD)
(6) Number of viewareas (dnaD)
(7) View-Maxdistance depending on night and day (dnaD)
(8) movement efficiency (water/land) + pure aquatic and land-based creatures.
(9) Energy-resource
		stomach-content fills up energy
		energy is used to move/attack/eat/split/etc.
		age decay lowers the efficiency and speed of conversion between food and energy

Brain
(10) number of intercells depending on dna (dna-structure similarity calculation)
(11) neuron malfunction through age-decay

World
(12) Night&Day (-> (7))
(13) Water
(14) Plants lightly dna-dependent (better near water or further away) + pure aquatic and land-based plants. 
		- Color
		- Size
		- Stages?

Simulation
(15) option to follow selected creatures

Statistics
(16) Speciohistogram
		split-history and longlivity of species
		numberstrength depending on history-time
		

Technical
(17) Quadtrees for collision detection and vision calculation
(18) two way plant growth calculations
(19) plant system calculation only every x steps
(20) Brain calculation optimization through matrix-calculations.
